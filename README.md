# 60-473 Advanced Topics in Artificial Intelligence - Machine Learning
Assignment 2: SVM

This assignement is an exercise in using State Vector Machines (SVM). In this project, I applied SVM to different datasets
using different kernels to compare results.

The results of the assignment can be found in ./rudzinsz_a2.pdf


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Prior to running this code, you will need to install some dependencies:

```
sudo apt install python3-tk
pip3 install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib tkintr
```

## Usage

    python3 main.py

## Built With

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Used for reading data from .csv files
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) - Used for managing data
* [scikit-learn](scikit-learn.org) - Used scikit's SVM implimentation
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Used for plotting the results
