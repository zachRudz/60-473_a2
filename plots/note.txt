I've included plots from me running 1-NN and naive bayes (both with no CV) in "./general". 

"./other" contains some plots that I referenced in some of my questions.

"./q5" contains the plots that I used in question 5.

And then there's the one unclassified clusterInCluster plot.


Sorry these are in a bit of a mess, I did questions out of order, and didn't have as much overlap where I could have.
